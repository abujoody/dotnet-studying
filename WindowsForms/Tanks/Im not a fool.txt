If you download this project, don't laugh from its implementation.
I just followed some tutorial of some author. This person has great
theoretical skills but in my opinion this project is ugly implemented.
In future i'll try to refactor it (especially in redrawing mechanism
part) if author didn't propose another way (Im only on 12 from 55
lesson now). And this is only my opinion about this project (what if
you like it ?... :) ).
